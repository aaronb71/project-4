        <img src="wallpaper.jpg" alt="BMCC Campus" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;">
        <p>Borough of Manhattan Community College is located in the World Trade Center, New York City and provides a wide range of studies for various degrees. I am currently enrolled here as a Computer Science major and have met many kind and generous professors that are very good at what they do.</p>
        <p>This semester, I am taking Calculus II, Data Structures, Software Development classes, and more! I recommend this University to anyone that plans on taking their education to the next level.</p>
